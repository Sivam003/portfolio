        I’m a final-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in web development, software engineering, and machine learning. Over the past few years, I’ve dedicated myself to building real-world projects that bridge the gap between clean design and functional code.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        My primary focus lies in full stack development, where I work with React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB. I’ve also explored machine learning by building projects like email spam classifiers and medicine recommendation systems.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        Some of my key projects include a note-taking app, a React music player, and a blockchain-based flood relief fund tracker. These experiences taught me how to think critically about scalability, accessibility, and user experience.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        As I approach graduation, I’m looking for opportunities where I can grow as a developer and work on meaningful, real-world problems with motivated teams. I enjoy creating polished, performant, and thoughtful products that solve actual needs.
